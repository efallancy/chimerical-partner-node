# Chimerical Partner
> In Node JS

This is an app that I built as a remake to the Chimerical Partner that I made using Ruby on Rails.

This is also made using Express, React, Cheerio, Babel (as transpiler for ES6 and React), Webpack, Request and axios.

Some of the packages being used:
- css-loader
- style-loader
- webpack-dev-middleware
- webpack-hot-middleware

> **Still under progress.**

Also note that the API key being used is for Top Stories and the key is not supplied together with the code. To get your own API key, go to [The New York Times Developers](https://developer.nytimes.com/) website.
