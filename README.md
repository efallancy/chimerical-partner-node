# Chimerical Partner
> [Chimerical](https://chimerical.herokuapp.com) - In Node JS

> News feed, dashboard like app. Powered by New York Times, Forecast.IO and Google Maps.

This is an app that I built as a remake to the [Chimerical Partner](https://chimerical-partner.herokuapp.com) that I made using Ruby on Rails.

Made using Express, React, Cheerio, Babel (as transpiler for ES6 and React), Webpack, Request and axios.

Also note that the API key being used for news is the Top Stories and the key is not supplied together with the code. To get your own API key, go to [The New York Times Developer](https://developer.nytimes.com/) website.

Not forget to mention, Google reverse geocoding and Forecast.IO for weather are also being used. Hence, the API key can be requested from the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) website and [Forecast.IO](https://darksky.net) for the weather API key.
